# Representative sample of Indian Court Judgments 
A representative sample of Indian court judgment was created by taking most cited IndianKanoon judgments controlling for court and case type.
## Data 
The data for representative sample during 1950 to 2017 can be found [here](https://storage.googleapis.com/indianlegalbert/OPEN_SOURCED_FILES/Representative_Judgements_Sample/representative_judgement_sample.csv). It has IndianKanoon URL and full text of the judgment.

## Data Collection method
Most cited judgements are likely to be more important ones. But just taking most cited judgments from a given court would result in bias in certain types of cases (E.g. criminal cases). Hence it is needed to control for types cases to consider the variety of judgements. So we created following 8 types of cases (tax, criminal ,civil, Motor Vehicles, Land & Property, Industrial & Labour, Constitution, Financial) which are most frequently present. Classification of each judgement into one these 8 types is complex task. We have used naive approach to use act names for assigning a judgment to a case type. E.g. if judgment mentions "tax act" then most probably it belongs to "tax" category. Following are the key act names were used in the Indian Kanoon search queries.  
The search keywords are based on most famous acts of that case type.
